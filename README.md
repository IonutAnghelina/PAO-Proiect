# This project's theme is organizing the activity of a library.

It contains an interface Item, which all further item classes will implement.

It contains 2 abstract classes (Book and Notebook) which will be extended by "CookBook", "StoryBook" etc.

It also contains a service class for the library class, which implemens CRUD operations + sorting of the arrays in its members.
